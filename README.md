# A glimpse of prompt engineering
The notebook in this repository demonstrates the effective use and variation of prompt engineering in LLM. `icm_llm` notebook will walk you through zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inference techniques. This also shows how this prompt engineering can help us in getting the desired result without putting extra effort into model training/fine-tuning.
